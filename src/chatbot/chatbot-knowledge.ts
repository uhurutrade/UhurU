// This file is intentionally left with minimal code.
// The knowledge base is now indexed and retrieved dynamically via the RAG system
// implemented in `knowledge-indexer.ts` and used in `chat-flow.ts`.
// Keeping this file prevents import errors in other parts of the application
// that might still reference it, and it can be used for future exports
// related to the knowledge system if needed.
