# Vanilla Options
Vanilla options are financial derivatives that grant their buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specific date (expiration date). They are called "vanilla" because they are the most basic and straightforward options, without additional complex features.

There are two main types: call options and put options. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the asset, and is used by investors who believe the price of the asset will rise. Conversely, a put option gives the right to sell the asset, and is useful for those who expect the price to fall. The price paid for this right is called the "premium" and represents the maximum risk of the operation for the buyer. Options can be an attractive investment tool, either to speculate on market movements with a risk limited to the premium, or as a hedging strategy to protect an existing portfolio from potential losses.
